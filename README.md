**Title : Crude Palm Oil Spot Price Prediction with Multivariate LSTM Model**

**(1)** Crude palm oil (CPO) spot price prediction is a multivariate time-series problem that can be solved by long short-term memory (LSTM) model, which is a deep learning algorithm leveraging on recurrent neural network.

**(2)** The model's goodness-of-fit and predictive power are evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error (RSME). This model serve as a preliminary model, future work to enhance the model performance by (1) Hyper-parameter tuning. (2) Ingestion of daily data.

**(3)** Production will take place in Google Colab, which will create an API to grab the data source from Git Hub repositories and ultimately output the prediction result in Google's cloud server. The implemented model can be retrieved below:

Note : The spot price forecast result for CPO is output as a csv file (i.e. PRED_N3MTH.csv).
