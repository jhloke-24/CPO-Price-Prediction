**Title : Crude Palm Oil Spot Price Prediction with Multivariate LSTM Model**

Background : Crude palm oil (CPO) spot price prediction is a multivariate time-series problem that can be solved by long short-term memory (LSTM) model, which is a deep learning algorithm leveraging on recurrent neural network.

Remark : The model is productionise using Google Cola, which would grab the data source from Git Hub repositories.
