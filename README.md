**Title : Crude Palm Oil Spot Price Prediction with Multivariate LSTM Model**

(1) Crude palm oil (CPO) spot price prediction is a multivariate time-series problem that can be solved by long short-term memory (LSTM) model, which is a deep learning algorithm leveraging on recurrent neural network.

(2) Production will take place in Google Colab, which will create an API to grab the data source from Git Hub repositories and ultimately output the prediction result in Google Colab server. The implemented model can be retrieved below:
